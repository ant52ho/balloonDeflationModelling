Hello, this is the folder where I’ve stored my programs and also the balloon deflation video I took. 

I’ve also added a spreadsheet where I’ve directly copied my collected data. However, since the data is copied, it doesn’t come with all the graphs I’ve created. 

For clarity, videoAnalysis.py “runs” balloonWidth.py. When running the programs, I run videoAnalysis.py, which uses the code within balloonWidth.py and the footage from IMG_6369.MOV

Feel free to look around.
